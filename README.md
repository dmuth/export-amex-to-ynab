# Covnert American Express CSVs to YNAB

For my personal finance, I use an app called <a href="https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=PreCBGSWL1digXGL&utm_source=customer_referral">You Need A Budget</a>, or YNAB.
It works pretty well for my needs, but seems to regularly have problems importing 
transactions from my American Express card.  In a fit of frustration, I built a 
little app to conver the AmEx CSV format to the format that YNAB needs, and thought 
I would share it here.
